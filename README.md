# SF911

The time it takes for a medical first response team (EMTs and paramedics) to arrive on scene to a 911 call varies by many minutes, but every minute counts when dealing with a potentially life-threatening incident.

Here, I propose a random forest regression model that uses temporal, geospatial, and vehicle deployment features associated with over 380,000 past 911 calls in San Francisco to provide a more accurate ETA for new calls.
